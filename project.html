            <h1>Supernova Technology</h1>
            <h2>Internship Project</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2019, I interned for a fintech startup in Chicago called Supernova Technology. 
            Supernova Technology specializes in securities based lending solutions and provides these solutions 
            through their digital lending software. At the time I was there, the company was nearing the end stages
            of redesigning their website. With the launch of their new website, they also wanted to redesign their
            brochures, one-pagers, and any other sort of media that would be shown to potential customers. </p>

        <div class="supernova_text" aria-label="Supernova project text">
            <p>The media I was tasked with redesigning were the company one-pagers. The one-pagers were informational brochures
                which detailed the features of each of the key components to Supernova's securities based lending digital software. In total, there were 6
                one-pagers, one for each key component to their digital lending software. The previous one-pagers, pictures aboved, were
                lacking visually and did not match their new website's aesthetic. Thus, drawing from the visual cues used to design
                the new website, I redesigned the one-pagers to match the aesthetic. My work was done in Sketch, a vector graphics
                editing software. In the new one-pagers, pictured below, I included updated information, icons, and website captures.</p>
